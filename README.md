## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've done quite a few JavaScript project now for beginners. It's still pretty hard for me though but I getting on quite well. I will continue to take on more project to polish  my JS skills. In this project, I learned a lot about `form` validations. This project was focused on form validations and it was really interesting indeed.

### Continued development

I'm still a beginner in javascript. So I will continue to forge ahead and complete more projects until I become confident in my Javascript abilities.
